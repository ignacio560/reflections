1.- What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

The metadata for the repository is created, but no commits are made yet.

2.- How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's an intermediate step between the two, allowing you to make sure how
many files you want to commit before doing so.





Materia:
git init: initializes a new repository.
git status: it shows which files have changed since the last commit.
git add: adds files to the staging area.
git commit
git commit -m "Commit message"

Etapas: working directory, staging area, repository.
