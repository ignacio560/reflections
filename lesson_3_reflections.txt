1.- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

It offers cloud advantages, allowing you to work on any project from any
computer. It also allows other people to collaborate on the project, and if
pushed to the remote repository, everyone working in the project can update
their local files.

2.- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to know what I'm pulling, and wouldn't like to have my files
modified without me actually wanting that to happen.

Summary:
git remote: shows all the remotes in the repository. Empty if none.

git remote add name url: Add 'adds' this repository on GitHub as a remote,
name is the name which we'll use to refer to the repository from GitHub.
If there's only one, it's standard to call it 'origin'. Url is where I'll
link it.

git remote -v: verbose. The output now will show the url to which we push and
fetch data from.

git push remote local_branch_to_push: it pushes the commits from the remote
to GitHub. It takes two arguments: the name of the remote I want to send
changes to and the branch I'd like to push. On GitHub, the branch will also
be called "local_branch_to_push"

git pull remote branch_to_pull: allows for local updates from the remote GitHub
repository.
